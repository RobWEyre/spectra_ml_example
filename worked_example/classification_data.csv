of uk government bonds gilts as part of anexperimental series of bond auctions later this year marketsources said the principle that this when issued trading should takeplace has been accepted by the executive committee of theinternational stock exchange said george nissen chairman ofthe gilt edged market makers association gemma its aquestion of how rather than whether he told reuters the bank of england announced in february that it planned apossible series of experimental auctions for gilts similar tothe system used to market us treasury issues with the firstauction possibly in april or may the bank said at that stage that it was not opposed inprinciple to when issued trading developing in bonds in theperiod between the announcement of full details of the auctionand the auction itself as in the us however when issued trading is prohibited under the rulesof the international stock exchange formerly the london stockexchange and would require an amendment in order to proceed nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rulechange to allow when issued trading were still taking placebetween the government broker at the bank of england and thequotations department of the stock exchange the giltedged primary dealers regard the introductionof grey market trading as an essential feature of an auctionsystem covering part of the governments funding needs if we are going into an

issued market certainly functionsvery efficiently he said nissen said he believed that if when issued trading werenot allowed marketmakers would be extremely unhappy about thewhole auction gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of stockexchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stockuntil it was listed by the quotations department however thiswas mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up inequities prior to listing they pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertaintiesconnected with an issue of equity securities there would befew imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued bythe bank of england senior market sources noted that in any case when issuedtrading would be supervised by the stock exchange and would besubject to bank of england supervisory guidelines since the bank of england and marketmakers themselves areknown to be in favour of the idea the sources said there wasnow a presumption that there would be scope for when issuedtrading to take place gilt sales now are effected by means of largescale stocktenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to themarket but greater market capitalisation following the bigbang restructuring last year provided an opportunity forchange a combination of both systems would enable the bank tobenefit from both the flexibility offered by traditionalmarketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of fundsimplied by auctions the bank said in a consultative document published infebruary that possibly two or three experimental auctions mighteach raise between one to billion stg the remainder of the funding would be conducted bytraditional tender and tap issue means total gross officialsales of giltedged stock were billion stg in nissen said that marketmakers had agreed unanimously withthe banks view that auctions would be more easily conducted ona price basis rather than based on yield he said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of abid price form of auction where successful bidders wereallotted stock at the various prices at which they bid ratherthan a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated atthe lowest accepted price hartnell said that while a when issued facility was crucialto marketmakers adaptation to the new system he would alsohave liked to see an extension to the fallow period proposalmade by the bank of england the bank said that it would not sell by any method stock ofthe same type as that to be auctioned between the time of theannouncement of auction details and a period ending daysafter the auction itself noting that in the case of long bond auctions us primarydealers have as much as three months between successive salesof stock hartnell said the banks proposal was very tight nissen said that following a meeting between gemma and thebank of england on march which he described as very helpfulgemma submitted a note making several further residual points marketmakers are now awaiting a further fairlydefinitive paper from the bank which would contain details ofauction procedures although the bank has not yet formallyannounced a definite intention to proceed with the auctionsmost market

prevent a grey market springing up inequities prior to listing they pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertaintiesconnected with an issue of equity securities there would befew imponderables

issuedtrading to take place gilt sales now are effected by means of largescale stocktenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to themarket but greater market capitalisation following the

to billion stg the remainder of the funding would be conducted bytraditional tender and tap issue means total gross officialsales of giltedged stock were billion stg in nissen said that marketmakers had agreed unanimously withthe banks view that auctions would be more easily conducted ona price basis rather than based on yield he said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of abid price form of auction where successful bidders wereallotted stock at the various prices at which they bid ratherthan a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated atthe lowest accepted price hartnell said that while a when issued facility was crucialto marketmakers adaptation to the new system he would alsohave liked to see an extension to the fallow period proposalmade by the bank of england the bank said that it would not sell by any method stock ofthe same type as that to be auctioned between the time of theannouncement of auction details and a period ending daysafter the auction itself noting that in the case of long bond auctions us primarydealers have as much as three months between successive salesof stock hartnell said the banks proposal was very tight nissen said that following a meeting between gemma and thebank of england on march which he described as very helpfulgemma submitted a note making several further residual points marketmakers are now awaiting a further fairlydefinitive paper from the bank which would contain details ofauction procedures although the bank has not yet formallyannounced a definite intention to proceed with the auctionsmost market

1,british banks resist signing mexico package by marguerite nugent reuters london march british banks are resisting signing a billion dlr rescheduling package for mexico in a last ditcheffort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new billion dlr loan contained in the package christopher brougham regional manager rescheduling unitat lloyds bank plc said in response to a reuter enquiry thatthe six major uk clearing banks last week sent a telex tocitibank saying they would contribute what was requestedprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the usbanks contribute at least pct of the amount required bythem other bankers who declined to be identified said othergroups of banks particularly those in switzerland france andcanada were equally reluctant to sign although they had notsent any telex to citibank which chairs mexicos bankadvisory group however they said it was likely that if and when thebritish banks sign the accord the others are likely to follow under the agreement for which the signing began on fridaycommercial banks are being asked to contribute pct oftheir exposure to mexico as of august that was the dateof the first mexican debt crisis after months of haggling a proposed rescheduling agreementfor mexico was struck last september during the annual meetingof the world bank and international monetary fund inwashington ever since then the advisory group of which lloyds is amember has been attempting to round up the needed signatories however there has been considerable resistance to thepackage partly because of some of the clauses it contains andpartly because many small us regional banks do not want toincrease their exposure to any latin american countries brougham said we british banks have always played alongfor mexico and will do so as long as others share equally the decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the sixclearers jointly but each sent its own telex in addition to lloyds telexes were sent by nationalwestminster bank plc barclays bank plc midland bank plctandard chartered bank plc and royal bank of scotland plc brougham noted that so far the us banks have only reached pct of the total that is expected from them while thelevel of contributions from the uk banks is well in excess of pct the us figure should be closer to ours he said many bankers have been angered by the resistance of theregional us banks noting that even if they dont contributeto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on theexisting loans the banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement andbankers are hoping all will go according to plan in the meantime bankers expect further pressure will beexercised on the regional banks and the major us banks tofind a solution to the problem many have suggested that thelarger us banks should take on the additional obligationsbut so far they have resisted this bankers expect that much of the pressure on the us bankswill come from us regulators notably the federal reserve bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the britishbanks and other national groups as a matter of principal andburden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force theus banks to make up their share the bankers are not the only ones to be upset by theprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement the mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays atthe signing in new york last friday finance minister gustavopetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks those who supported us today can be sure that mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create petriciolisaid conversion of bank debt into equity investments in mexicois one option banks can take advantage of to reduce theirexposure but mexico halted its debt for equity program infebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package on friday petricioli said we will be a lot moreexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that havesupported us the pressure on the us banks comes at a time when othermajor latin american debtors are in the process of crucial debtnegotiations brazil the third worlds largest debtor has suspended allinterest payments on its billion dlrs of foreign debt manyof the major us banks including citibank have already saidthey might have to put their brazil

1,exchange seen approving when issued gilt trade by sandy critchley reuters london april the stock exchange is virtually certainto agree to change its regulations in order to permit whenissued trading of uk government bonds gilts as part of anexperimental series of bond auctions later this year marketsources said the principle that this when issued trading should takeplace has been accepted by the executive committee of theinternational stock exchange said george nissen chairman ofthe gilt edged market makers association gemma its aquestion of how rather than whether he told reuters the bank of england announced in february that it planned apossible series of experimental auctions for gilts similar tothe system used to market us treasury issues with the firstauction possibly in april or may the bank said at that stage that it was not opposed inprinciple to when issued trading developing in bonds in theperiod between the announcement of full details of the auctionand the auction itself as in the us however when issued trading is prohibited under the rulesof the international stock exchange formerly the london stockexchange and would require an amendment in order to proceed nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rulechange to allow when issued trading were still taking placebetween the government broker at the bank of england and thequotations department of the stock

issued market certainly functionsvery efficiently he said nissen said he believed that if when issued trading werenot allowed marketmakers would be extremely unhappy about thewhole auction gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of stockexchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stockuntil it was listed by the quotations department however thiswas mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up inequities prior to listing they pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertaintiesconnected with an issue of equity securities there would befew imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued bythe bank of england senior market sources noted that in any case when issuedtrading would be supervised by the stock exchange and would besubject to bank of england supervisory guidelines since the bank of england and marketmakers themselves areknown to be in favour of the idea the sources said there wasnow a presumption that there would be scope for when issuedtrading to take place gilt sales now are effected by means of largescale stocktenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to themarket but greater market capitalisation following the bigbang restructuring last year provided an opportunity forchange a combination of both systems would enable the bank tobenefit from both the flexibility offered by traditionalmarketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of fundsimplied by auctions the bank said in a consultative document published infebruary that possibly two or three experimental auctions mighteach raise between one to billion stg the remainder of the funding would be conducted bytraditional tender and tap issue means total gross officialsales of giltedged stock were billion stg in nissen said that marketmakers had agreed unanimously withthe banks view that auctions would be more easily conducted ona price basis rather than based on yield he said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of abid price form of auction where successful bidders wereallotted stock at the various prices at which they bid ratherthan a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated atthe lowest accepted price hartnell said that while a when issued facility was crucialto marketmakers adaptation to the new system he would alsohave liked to see an extension to the fallow period proposalmade by the bank of england the bank said that it would not sell by any method stock ofthe same type as that to be auctioned between the time of theannouncement of auction details and a period ending daysafter the auction itself noting that in the case of long bond auctions us primarydealers have as much as three months between successive salesof stock hartnell said the banks proposal was very tight nissen said that following a meeting between gemma and thebank of england on march which he described as very helpfulgemma submitted a note making several further residual points marketmakers are now awaiting a further fairlydefinitive paper from the bank which would contain details ofauction procedures although the bank has not yet formallyannounced a definite intention to proceed with the auctionsmost market

authorizationto be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets in addition the bank has proposed limits on the amount ofcredit risk that firms can take on with each new issue theylead manage the proposed rules were outlined today in a consultativepaper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks anddeposit takers and may be modified the bank said the rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobondsecurities issued each year in about billion dlrs ofnew eurobonds were offered according to figures compiled byeuromoney magazine up until now there have been no restrictions on leadmanaging eurobond issues however eurobond market participants believe the bank ofengland is concerned about intense competition for market sharewhich may have caused some firms to expose themselves toimprudent credit risk competition for market share has been a boon to issuers asbanks compete to offer the best terms but the new rulessuggest that some constraints may be placed on competition asregulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more riskthan it can handle banking sources said that while the bank ofengland is reluctant to inhibit competition it is willing toaccept some constraints in order to ensure that underwritersact prudently the banks assessment of the appropriateness of a bankslead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skilland experience of the lead underwriter in the particular marketconcerned the banks proposal said once a firm has received permission to act as leadunderwriter the exposure will be valued at onesixth of theface amount of the securities nominal exposure exceeding pct of capital must be reported to the bank of england and itmust be notified in advance for exposure of over pct ofcapital the exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of days following a binding commitment to underwrite afterthat any remaining exposure from unsold securities will beassessed at their full face value the rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilitiesrevolving credits or commercial paper the bank said the bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthenits supervisory powers over banks in the paper which calledfor comments from professionals by march to allow theirpossible inclusion in the banking bill in time for its plannedfinal discussion in parliament scheduled before summer the new banking bill updating the banking act is thethird leg of the conservative governments legislation for thesupervision of financial institutions it is to feature alongside the financial services actaimed to bolster investor protection and the buildingsocieties act which put these institutions on an equal footingwith banks the proposed legislation would abolish distinctions betweenrecognised banks and licensed deposittakers and tighten legalcontrols making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors proposals to require banks to inform the bank of england inadvance of planned exposures in excess of pct of theircapital and to have the bank supervise exposures between and pct of capital were not under debate the paper showed however preliminary consultations with bankrepresentatives had shown some of the initial proposals to beflawed it said most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on acasebycase basis rather than along general lines amendments involved the banks proposed treatment ofexposures by financial institutions acting as banker to otherunits of their own group of companies the paper showed they also regarded the treatment of credit exposure tolocal governments and other public sector entities and ofexposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor ascollateral to a credit were slightly changed the paper showed exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within theirown group of companies would usually be looked into on acasebycase basis under new proposals it said the paper said exposures to stateowned industries andother public sector authorities in the uk and abroad shouldbe given the more lenient treatment of credits to governmentsprovided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees it cautioned that exposures to uk local authorities andthose guaranteed by the british export credit guaranteedepartment would probably not qualify for such treatment on credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary ofanother bank an earlierproposed pct of capital ceilingcould be exceeded in individual cases but the parent bank would have to give a formal undertakingto take over the exposure if problems were to occur and statein writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiarysbalance sheet to meet precise group objectives the paper said on collateral security it said this should normally onlybe taken into account when considering the acceptability of abanks exposure up to pct of its capital base the presence of security taken on its own will beconsidered by the bank as an acceptable reason for an exposurein excess of pct but only in the most exceptionalcircumstances and even then to a very limited extent it said reuter

all participants to contribute equally to a new billion dlr loan contained in the package christopher brougham regional manager rescheduling unitat lloyds bank plc said in response to a reuter enquiry thatthe six major uk clearing banks last week sent a telex tocitibank saying they would contribute what was requestedprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the usbanks contribute at least pct of the amount required bythem other bankers who declined to be identified said othergroups of banks particularly those in switzerland france andcanada were equally reluctant to sign although they had notsent any telex to citibank which chairs mexicos bankadvisory group however they said it was likely that if and when thebritish banks sign the accord the others are likely to follow under the agreement for which the signing began on fridaycommercial banks are being asked to contribute pct oftheir exposure to mexico as of august that was the dateof the first mexican debt crisis after months of haggling a proposed rescheduling agreementfor mexico was struck last september during the annual meetingof the world bank and international monetary fund inwashington ever since then the advisory group of which lloyds is amember has been attempting to round up the needed signatories however there has been considerable resistance to thepackage partly because of some of the clauses it contains andpartly because many small us regional banks do not want toincrease their exposure to any latin american countries brougham said we british banks have always played alongfor mexico and will do so as long as others share equally the decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the sixclearers jointly but each sent its own telex in addition to lloyds telexes were sent by nationalwestminster bank plc barclays bank plc midland bank plctandard chartered bank plc and royal bank of scotland plc brougham noted that so far the us banks have only reached pct of the total that is expected from them while thelevel of contributions from the uk banks is well in excess of pct the us figure should be closer to ours he said many bankers have been angered by the resistance of theregional us banks noting that even if they dont contributeto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on theexisting loans the banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement andbankers are hoping all will go according to plan in the meantime bankers expect further pressure will beexercised on the regional banks and the major us banks tofind a solution to the problem many have suggested that thelarger us banks should take on the additional obligationsbut so far they have resisted this bankers expect that much of the pressure on the us bankswill come from us regulators notably the federal reserve bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the britishbanks and other national groups as a matter of principal andburden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force theus banks to make up their share the bankers are not the only ones to be upset by theprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement the mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays atthe signing in new york last friday finance minister gustavopetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks those who supported us today can be sure that mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create petriciolisaid conversion of bank debt into equity investments in mexicois one option banks can take advantage of to reduce theirexposure but mexico halted its debt for equity program infebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package on friday petricioli said we will be a lot moreexpeditious in
