all participants to contribute equally to a new billion dlr loan contained in the package christopher brougham regional manager rescheduling unitat lloyds bank plc said in response to a reuter enquiry thatthe six major uk clearing banks last week sent a telex tocitibank saying they would contribute what was requestedprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the usbanks contribute at least pct of the amount required bythem other bankers who declined to be identified said othergroups of banks particularly those in switzerland france andcanada were equally reluctant to sign although they had notsent any telex to citibank which chairs mexicos bankadvisory group however they said it was likely that if and when thebritish banks sign the accord the others are likely to follow under the agreement for which the signing began on fridaycommercial banks are being asked to contribute pct oftheir exposure to mexico as of august that was the dateof the first mexican debt crisis after months of haggling a proposed rescheduling agreementfor mexico was struck last september during the annual meetingof the world bank and international monetary fund inwashington ever since then the advisory group of which lloyds is amember has been attempting to round up the needed signatories however there has been considerable resistance to thepackage partly because of some of the clauses it contains andpartly because many small us regional banks do not want toincrease their exposure to any latin american countries brougham said we british banks have always played alongfor mexico and will do so as long as others share equally the decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the sixclearers jointly but each sent its own telex in addition to lloyds telexes were sent by nationalwestminster bank plc barclays bank plc midland bank plctandard chartered bank plc and royal bank of scotland plc brougham noted that so far the us banks have only reached pct of the total that is expected from them while thelevel of contributions from the uk banks is well in excess of pct the us figure should be closer to ours he said many bankers have been angered by the resistance of theregional us banks noting that even if they dont contributeto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on theexisting loans the banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement andbankers are hoping all will go according to plan in the meantime bankers expect further pressure will beexercised on the regional banks and the major us banks tofind a solution to the problem many have suggested that thelarger us banks should take on the additional obligationsbut so far they have resisted this bankers expect that much of the pressure on the us bankswill come from us regulators notably the federal reserve bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the britishbanks and other national groups as a matter of principal andburden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force theus banks to make up their share the bankers are not the only ones to be upset by theprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement the mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays atthe signing in new york last friday finance minister gustavopetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks those who supported us today can be sure that mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create petriciolisaid conversion of bank debt into equity investments in mexicois one option banks can take advantage of to reduce theirexposure but mexico halted its debt for equity program infebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package on friday petricioli said we will be a lot moreexpeditious in

all participants to contribute equally to a new billion dlr loan contained in the package christopher brougham regional manager rescheduling unitat lloyds bank plc said in response to a reuter enquiry thatthe six major uk clearing banks last week sent a telex tocitibank saying they would contribute what was requestedprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the usbanks contribute at least pct of the amount required bythem other bankers who declined to be identified said othergroups of banks particularly those in switzerland france andcanada were equally reluctant to sign although they had notsent any telex to citibank which chairs mexicos bankadvisory group however they said it was likely that if and when thebritish banks sign the accord the others are likely to follow under the agreement for which the signing began on fridaycommercial banks are being asked to contribute pct oftheir exposure to mexico as of august that was the dateof the first mexican debt crisis after months of haggling a proposed rescheduling agreementfor mexico was struck last september during the annual meetingof the world bank and international monetary fund inwashington ever since then the advisory group of which lloyds is amember has been attempting to round up the needed signatories however there has been considerable resistance to thepackage partly because of some of the clauses it contains andpartly because many small us regional banks do not want toincrease their exposure to any latin american countries brougham said we british banks have always played alongfor mexico and will do so as long as others share equally the decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the sixclearers jointly but each sent its own telex in addition to lloyds telexes were sent by nationalwestminster bank plc barclays bank plc midland bank plctandard chartered bank plc and royal bank of scotland plc brougham noted that so far the us banks have only reached pct of the total that is expected from them while thelevel of contributions from the uk banks is well in excess of pct the us figure should be closer to ours he said many bankers have been angered by the resistance of theregional us banks noting that even if they dont contributeto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on theexisting loans the banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement andbankers are hoping all will go according to plan in the meantime bankers expect further pressure will beexercised on the regional banks and the major us banks tofind a solution to the problem many have suggested that thelarger us banks should take on the additional obligationsbut so far they have resisted this bankers expect that much of the pressure on the us bankswill come from us regulators notably the federal reserve bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the britishbanks and other national groups as a matter of principal andburden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force theus banks to make up their share the bankers are not the only ones to be upset by theprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement the mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays atthe signing in new york last friday finance minister gustavopetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks those who supported us today can be sure that mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create petriciolisaid conversion of bank debt into equity investments in mexicois one option banks can take advantage of to reduce theirexposure but mexico halted its debt for equity program infebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package on friday petricioli said we will be a lot moreexpeditious in
